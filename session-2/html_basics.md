## Session 2: HTML Basics

## What is HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and how its content is displayed online and is known as the backbone of the internet.

HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

## The structure of a HTML page

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
    	    <meta charset="utf-8">
    	    <title>My example page</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        </body>
    </html>

`<!DOCTYPE html>`

- This the HTML5 doctype, it is required at the top of every HTML document and it makes sure your document behaves correctly.

`<html></html>`

- The html element, also know as the root element, wraps all the content that is in the page.

`<head></head>`

- The head element, this is a container for all the stuff you want to include on the page that isn't the content you are showing. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.

`<meta charset="utf-8">`

- This element sets the character set your document should use, here we set the charset="uft-8" which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages.

`<title></title>`

- The title element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in.

`<body></body>`

- The body element. This contains all the content that you want to show to on your page, whether that's text, images, videos, or anything else.

## What does an HTML element look like

There are many different HTML elements that can be used for different things, some good resources to find out about different ones you can use are:

## Common elements for marking up text

### Headings

Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles. There are heading levels 1-6 that you can use throughout your page but you'll only want one `<h1>` which will be the main title of your page.

```
<h1>My main title</h1>
<h2>My top level heading</h2>
<h3>My subheading</h3>
<h4>My sub-subheading</h4>
<h5>My small subheading</h5>
<h6>My extra small heading</h6>
```

### Paragraphs

`<p>` elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these a lot when marking up regular content.

```
<p>This is a single paragraph</p>
```

### Lists

The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:

1.  **Unordered lists** are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a `<ul>` element. These lists will show as bullet points.
2.  **Ordered lists** are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an `<ol>` element. These lists will show as numbered bullet points.

```
<p>My Shopping list</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pizza</li>
  <li>Bread</li>
  <li>Crisps</li>
</ul>


<p>The steps to follow to make toast are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get 2 slices of bread</li>
  <li>Put the bread in the toaster</li>
  <li>Press the toaster down</li>
</ol>

```

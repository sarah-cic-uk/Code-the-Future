### Sarah

I joined IBM CIC as a graduate in 2016. Before IBM I studied and worked in Animal Behaviour,
Conservation and Engineering. It annoyed me that there was no software out there to help in
my fish conservation research so I took a free evening course (much like this one!) to see if
it was possible to learn to code and build the software that I needed. Soon after, I met someone
from IBM CIC who suggested I apply because I showed enthusiasm and knew enough of the basics -
they would teach me everything else I needed to know. I'm now a Managing Developer and Development Lead for two dev
teams and I love my job.

### Vivienne

I joined IBM CIC as an associate in February 2021. Before IBM, I studied in the field of research in Applied Mathematics and Computational Modelling. After completing a year as a PhD student, I decided I wanted to explore a different aspect of programming. I applied for the Application Developer role at IBM and never expected to get it! Although I had some programming skills, I knew nothing about software development... Luckily, this role included 9 weeks of developer training and, although I have only been in this role for a short amount of time, I am really enjoying it. I am very much still new to the development world and am learning more and more every day at IBM.

### Georgia

After finishing my A Levels I wasn't sure what I wanted to do for a career. I looked at different University
options and the Computer Science course caught my eye. That was where I created my first programme (in C)
and I was hooked from there. Now I have worked for IBM CIC since 2018 and been given the opportunity to work
as a full stack Developer and Scrum Master. I enjoy the variation of tasks I get in my role, that I am able
to keep learning during my role and how no two weeks are the same!


### Kristel

I joined IBM CIC as a Developer in March 2021. I started my career as a functional consultant and worked with various proprietary software. I wanted more hands-on experience creating applications from "scratch" and not to get tied down to a single architecture/platform. I switched to full stack development, building bespoke applications both in and outside of work, where I quickly developed my technical knowledge and skills over the years. I am enjoying the variety of work at my current role and looking forward to the numerous possibilities of career growth that IBM has to offer.

### Remya

After my computer science engineering degree I started my career as a server administrator. I switched my career to a developer a few years later and have been one for the past 7 years. I am currently a full stack developer. I joined IBM CIC in May 2021. I enjoy code development and look forward to learning new technologies in my role in IBM.

### Henry

I joined IBM as an Associate Developer in February 2021. Before IBM, I studied Economics at the University of Exeter with the aim of working in ethical finance. I took a job at Monzo Bank but quickly realised that I wanted to be a developer, designing the amazing tools I was using to help millions of people. So I enrolled on an MSc conversion course in Computer Science at Birkbeck University and applied for a role here at IBM. I'm already loving the job which, most importantly, gives me almost unlimited scope for creativity and many oportunities to contribute to the causes I care about.

### Sam

I joined IBM in February 2021 as an Associate Developer. Before joining IBM I studied artificial intelligence, with a focus on autonomous robotics, wanting to create robots that could help people and make their lives easier. I really enjoy the work I do here, creatively problem solving on tools that will make peoples lives easier. I'm currently training in new tools to move my career towards artificical intelligence research, as that's where I believe I can best help.

### Aum

Hola! I joined IBM CIC in June 2021 as a graduate. I studied Computer Science with a focus in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Kent. Even though it's been a short period in my current role, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time working at IBM due to the vast amount of self growth opportunities and the constant learning experiences IBM provides.

### Rachel

I joined the CIC in 2016 as a graduate Developer, since then I have been on various projects in a range of roles in Dev, Test, PMO and DevOps. I studied Computing at University and did a year in Industry as a Software Packager. I enjoy the fact I am able to learn a lot through CIC and explore career growth in a range of areas.

### Amber

I joined IBM CIC as a Senior Test Specialist in October 2021. Before IBM, I studied computing science and then went further to acquire a Masters degree in Business Systems Analysis and Design with the aim of becoming a Business Analyst. Later I realised I was a very inquisitive and success driven person who always wants things done in the right way, (almost perfect) quality enough to yield success. I took a job at SNC-Lavlin Atkins where I was the sole Test Engineer working on the Heathrow Aviation project and checking to ensure the facial recognition system could actually recognise a passenger’s face. Whilst working on that project, I realised that being a tester wasn’t enough, I needed to learn and understand the backend of a software, which then made me take on the position of QA Automation Engineer at IBM. I am now being taught how to code in Java Language. I have learnt a lot since I joined IBM and the trainings and career progression IBM offers is second to none.

### Davina

I joined IBM in June 2021 as a Project Manager and I'm currently working as a Scrum Master on my current assignment. I have been in IT since 2004 after graduating in IT with Business Information Systems. Although my career has predominately been on the infrastructure delivery side, developing in java and HTML were a big part of my degree many moons ago! I love working as a Project Manager as I get to work on a variety of projects which pushes you to further develop your understanding of this ever evolving industry. 

### Kadijah

I joined IBM CIC as an Associate Technology Specialist in August 2022. Before this I studied Accounting and Finance and although I enjoyed it, I realised I enjoyed coding a lot more once I did this Code The Future last year. I was encouraged to apply by my then-tutors and went through the process and ended up here! I've come in with basic HTML and CSS knowledge but I am learning more and more everyday.

## Session 1: Using Git in VScode

### Content covered in this session

- How to pull and push code from your IDE

### Session goals

- Pull code from your repo from VScode
- Make a change and push your code back up to the repo from VScode


### Using Git within VScode

For this to work, make sure you open your folder/workspace at the root (top-level) of your repo.

On the left hand side of VScode there is a menu bar down the side of the page. There is one that looks like a git branch (usually 3rd down by default). Click this icon. (If you hover over the icon it says Source Control)

This will open up a panel on the left called Source Control.

#### Pulling your repo code

1. Where you have the Source Control dropdown, hover over it and you'll see a 3-dot menu.
1. Inside the menu there is a Pull option. Open up the options and select Pull.
1. if you want to pull from another branch or the remote (when team working) you can select those options from the same menu.
1. If you know there will be merge conflicts with others from your team you can use Merge instead of Pull.
1. Your local code should update with all the latest changes.

#### Pushing your changes

1. You can see a list of your changes, as well as any merge conflicts if team working with others.
1. Hover over the word 'Changes' and you'll notice options appear. From here you can add all your files to staging. Alternatively, you can hover on each file and add them 1 by 1 (useful for if you don't want to commit everything you have changed).
1. Add a commit message in the Message input box.
1. Click commit!
1. Click 'Sync Changes' to push.

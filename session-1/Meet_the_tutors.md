### Sarah

I joined IBM CIC as a graduate in 2016. Before IBM I studied and worked in Animal Behaviour,
Conservation and Engineering. It annoyed me that there was no software out there to help in
my fish conservation research so I took a free evening course (much like this one!) to see if
it was possible to learn to code and build the software that I needed. Soon after, I met someone
from IBM CIC who suggested I apply because I showed enthusiasm and knew enough of the basics -
they would teach me everything else I needed to know. I'm now a Managing Developer and Development Lead for two dev
teams and I love my job.

### Jacqueline

After leaving school/college I spent a long time in the hairdressing industry, one day I began learning code in my own spare time, very much like this which kick-started me onto a new career path. I had already had over 10 years experience in UX/UI design and development before I was approached by someone from the CIC who saw my online portfolio and suggested that I attend a CIC assessment centre, that was over 5 and a half years ago now. Since, I have been with the CIC I've pushed myself out of my comfort zone learning new tech, languages and methodologies however being surrounded by such a high calibre of talented peers and the support of the CIC meant those achievements were within reach.

### Jacob

I joined IBM CIC as a Java Developer in September 2021, bust quickly transitioned into Front-end development and Javascript. Before IBM I worked as an IT Consultant where I was also contract out to IBM as a Java developer for 2 years, but made myself known and was hired by IBM CIC after my contract ended. I graduated from University studying Computer Science for Games, where i learnt a lot more about the gaming industry, but turned more to software as to not sour the tasting of gaming. I'm fairly new to tutoring so will have to help me learn as well but always enjoyed helping an teaching others.

### Bells (Obelema)

I joined IBM in 2022 as an experienced higher (Senior Business Analyst (BA)). Before IBM I have worked as an agile BA, a digital transformation BA, a software developer, freelance graphic designer, Associate Lecturer in computing (Human Computer Interaction) and several other computing area. I am also a trained teacher in information technology and secondary computer science which I took on because of my passion to reach out to more girls to join the computing career and technology industry. Currently at IBM, I work as a Senior Business Analyst/Business Architect and I enjoy what I do in IBM and look forward to tutor in trainings like code the future so I could leverage the platform to tutor more girls in computing, debias them of the myth that this industry are for boys only and encourage them to take on computer science / informaton technology as a career.

### Zubaida

Hi! I joined as an Associate Technology Specialist in August 2021. I studied Computer Science at University and since I have been able to utilise my skills throughout my role. Although it has been less than 2 years at IBM, I've throughly enjoyed my time in CIC where I'm not restricted to my hired role and can explore various growth opportunities and complete trainings/certifications where I would like to build on my skills set. I am fairly new to tutoring but I will try my at-most best to help you and ease your learning experience.

### Sophie

I’ve always had an interest in computers and video games. When I eventually went to university, my bachelors degree was in Games Technology, where I got to make several games and worked with some other students to publish a game to Xbox Live as part of a final year project. It was here that I learned the basics of programming and software development.

After graduating, I then joined my university as a lecturer, teaching newer students the same courses that I had just been studying. After a few years, I took up a PhD scholarship, studying a mixture of computer science and psychology, but I didn’t manage to quite finish it. I got to work with the Microsoft Kinect and 3D avatars in a robotics lab, though!

I joined IBM in March 2017 and have been working in the public sector ever since. I’m now a senior software engineer, and have worked on many different technologies, including Java, Javascript, C# and a bunch of backend systems. I’ve enjoyed my time, but I will be moving into a security role very soon.

### Abdul

Hi everyone, I joined IBM in February 2021 as an Application Developer. Before Joining IBM I was studying Computer systems engineering, so I have hands on experience in software and hardware. During my degree I have build hardware related projects such as: A smart walking stick (assistive technology) designed for visually impaired individuals, which used sensors and vibrations to notify the individual of any obstructions in their path. It also had thermal imaging for health care providers to see what the individual was able to see in real time. I have also done extensive research in 5G wave propagation as part of my dissertation, which optimised the way self driving vehicles communicate with each other. Since joining IBM I have worked on several projects building applications where I have worked on the development side and operations side. I am an advocate for learning and love the idea of learning something new every day!

### Michael

I joined the CIC in early December 2020 as an application developer. I've worked on a wide range of roles and accounts, working in L2 support, cloud solutions, app development and finally web development since the start of this year. I've had spinkles of experience throughout my career from using HTML/CSS to JavaScript/TypeScript with frameworks like React and Angular. I hope now to try to apply my web development knowledge through tutoring.

### Rachel

I joined the CIC in 2016 as a graduate Developer, since then I have been on various projects in a range of roles in Dev, Test, PMO and DevOps. I studied Computing at University and did a year in Industry as a Software Packager. I enjoy the fact I am able to learn a lot through CIC and explore career growth in a range of areas.

### Amber

I joined IBM CIC as a Senior Test Specialist in October 2021. Before IBM, I studied computing science and then went further to acquire a Masters degree in Business Systems Analysis and Design with the aim of becoming a Business Analyst. Later I realised I was a very inquisitive and success driven person who always wants things done in the right way, (almost perfect) quality enough to yield success. I took a job at SNC-Lavlin Atkins where I was the sole Test Engineer working on the Heathrow Aviation project and checking to ensure the facial recognition system could actually recognise a passenger’s face. Whilst working on that project, I realised that being a tester wasn’t enough, I needed to learn and understand the backend of a software, which then made me take on the position of QA Automation Engineer at IBM. I am now being taught how to code in Java Language. I have learnt a lot since I joined IBM and the trainings and career progression IBM offers is second to none.

### Davina

I joined IBM in June 2021 as a Project Manager and I'm currently working as a Scrum Master on my current assignment. I have been in IT since 2004 after graduating in IT with Business Information Systems. Although my career has predominately been on the infrastructure delivery side, developing in java and HTML were a big part of my degree many moons ago! I love working as a Project Manager as I get to work on a variety of projects which pushes you to further develop your understanding of this ever evolving industry.

### Lewis

I joined IBM in March 2022 as an Associate Application Developer and I am currently working with a Gov department called DBS to help make it easier for people and organisations to access people's criminal data. Before joining IBM I studied a Comp Science MSc at Uni of Birmingham and before that I worked as an international business, even living in Japan for a few years! However the constant flights/travel worn me out and I decided to change careers into IT - one of the best decisions I've ever made!

### Anujan

Hi! I joined IBM as an associate full stack developer 2 months ago. Having graduated from a physics degree, I decided to apply the skills I learnt there in a professional setting. During my degree, I learnt the basics of python, from then on, I did more and more projects in different languages. Now I’m coming towards the end of my training at IBM, I’m looking forward to put these skills into action.

### Georgia

After finishing my A Levels I wasn't sure what I wanted to do for a career. I looked at different University
options and the Computer Science course caught my eye. That was where I created my first programme (in C)
and I was hooked from there. Now I have worked for IBM CIC since 2018 and been given the opportunity to work
as a full stack Developer and Scrum Master. I enjoy the variation of tasks I get in my role, that I am able
to keep learning during my role and how no two weeks are the same!

### Vivienne

I joined IBM CIC as an associate in February 2021. Before IBM, I studied in the field of research in Applied Mathematics and Computational Modelling. After completing a year as a PhD student, I decided I wanted to explore a different aspect of programming. I applied for the Application Developer role at IBM and never expected to get it! Although I had some programming skills, I knew nothing about software development... Luckily, this role included 9 sessions of developer training and, although I have only been in this role for a short amount of time, I am really enjoying it. I am very much still new to the development world and am learning more and more every day at IBM.

### Kristel

I joined IBM CIC as a Developer in March 2021. I started my career as a functional consultant and worked with various proprietary software. I wanted more hands-on experience creating applications from "scratch" and not to get tied down to a single architecture/platform. I switched to full stack development, building bespoke applications both in and outside of work, where I quickly developed my technical knowledge and skills over the years. I am enjoying the variety of work at my current role and looking forward to the numerous possibilities of career growth that IBM has to offer.

### Remya

After my computer science engineering degree I started my career as a server administrator. I switched my career to a developer a few years later and have been one for the past 7 years. I am currently a full stack developer. I joined IBM CIC in May 2021. I enjoy code development and look forward to learning new technologies in my role in IBM.

### Kadijah

I joined IBM CIC as an Associate Technology Specialist in August 2022. Before this I studied Accounting and Finance and although I enjoyed it, I realised I enjoyed coding a lot more once I did this Code The Future last year. I was encouraged to apply by my then-tutors and went through the process and ended up here! I've come in with basic HTML and CSS knowledge but I am learning more and more everyday

### Sam

I joined IBM in February 2021 as an Associate Developer. Before joining IBM I studied artificial intelligence, with a focus on autonomous robotics, wanting to create robots that could help people and make their lives easier. I really enjoy the work I do here, creatively problem solving on tools that will make peoples lives easier. I'm currently training in new tools to move my career towards artificial intelligence research, as that's where I believe I can best help.

### Aum

Hola! I joined IBM CIC in June 2021 as a graduate. I studied Computer Science with a focus in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Kent. Even though it's been a short period in my current role, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time working at IBM due to the vast amount of self growth opportunities and the constant learning experiences IBM provides.

### Cameron

I’m a recent Computer Science graduate from Demontfort University and made a Uber-Eats style Android app for my project. Shortly after (just over a month ago), I started at IBM as an associate developer and I am extremely keen to get started on my first project at IBM. I love the openness and supportive nature that is so prevalent here along with the varied roles and prospects here.

### Andy

Hey! I joined the CIC as an Associate Developer in April 2022 after graduating. I studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Birmingham where I was introduced to coding in the form MATLAB and a short Introduction to Computing module focussing on C. I realised I had more interest in working on software than I did mechanical design. This lead me to apply for the Associate Developer Role in the CIC. Since I joined I have had abundant opportunities to learn and have particularly enjoyed exploring Vue.js and Node.js to make a variety of full-stack web applications.

### Dana

Joined IBM as an Associate Technical Specialist last October . Passionate about DevOps, VR, AR and medicine. Grounded human , hoping that “beam me up Scotty” will happen during my lifetime 😄. Working background prior to IBM was in healthcare setting, currently happy with 1 and 0.

### Henry

I joined IBM as an Associate Developer in February 2021. Before IBM, I studied Economics at the University of Exeter with the aim of working in ethical finance. I took a job at Monzo Bank but quickly realised that I wanted to be a developer, designing the amazing tools I was using to help millions of people. So I enrolled on an MSc conversion course in Computer Science at Birkbeck University and applied for a role here at IBM. I'm already loving the job which, most importantly, gives me almost unlimited scope for creativity and many opportunities to contribute to the causes I care about.

### Doaa

Assalam Alaykom! I joined IBM as an Associate in April 2022. Before IBM, I Studied 3 years of computer engineering at the Islamic University in Gaza, Palestine before moving into the UK and doing a BSc in computing at De Motfort University and then following it by a MSc in Data Analytics. After graduating, I volunteered at a faith school and foodback for 2 years till I had persmission to work and then applied for IBM right away. I enjoy working in IBM as I get to learn different technologies and pick up new skills and make a differance by working on great projects.

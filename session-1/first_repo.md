### Create Your First Repository

The goal of this tutorial is to teach you:

- How to make your first repository (sometimes referred to as a repo),
- Clone it to your local computer,
- Make a change,
- Push it back up to GitHub.

Now that you have Git installed, and have a GitHub account, let's get started:

1. Once logged to GitHub in the browser, click the "New" button on the left side of the screen on the Repositories page.
2. Give a name to this repository and be sure to check the box titled "Add a README file" and **make sure visibility is set to public**.
   This will ensure that you can easily clone down the repository.
3. Click "Create Repository".  
   Your repository is now created, and can be changed however you want.
   Everything saved here is backed up on GitHub, safe if you accidentally delete it on your personal computer.  
   Scroll down the page and you should see the title of your repository, our goal is to change this.
4. Click the "Code" button and take a look at the dropdown. 
5. From the dropdown you can copy a clone URL which you can use in <a href='git_and_vscode.md'>VScode</a>, <a href='git_and_terminal.md'>terminal</a> or <a href='git_and_desktop.md'>GitHub Desktop</a>, or download the repo as a ZIP and manually open it in your preferred IDE. For now we will use VScode; open up VScode and open the file explorer pane. Click 'Clone Repository' and paste your repo url.

6. In VSCode, navigate to the folder that you just cloned down.  
   Everything you change here will only be changed on your local copy, until you push it back up.
7. Open the only file in the folder, called README.md. This file is typically used to describe the project, any instructions to make it run, etc. In this tutorial we're just going to change it a little.
8. In README.md, delete everything (should only be one line), and write your name inside. Then make sure to save it.
9. To push and pull code you can use various methods: <a href='git_and_vscode.md'>VScode</a>, <a href='git_and_terminal.md'>terminal</a> or <a href='git_and_desktop.md'>GitHub Desktop</a>. Pick your preferred option and follow the tutorial.

You've now created a repository, cloned it, made a change, committed that change and pushed it back up to GitHub.

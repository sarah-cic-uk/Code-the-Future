# Session 5: Personal Project Planning

## Plan your site!

It can be hard to know where to start with a project, so here's some tips to help you plan:

- Plan out what pages you want.
- Plan out the content/images you want on the pages.
- Are there any features you know you want, like a gallery or social media buttons?
- Is there any learning/research you need to do to be able to do this?

## Example projects

We aren't looking for a masterpiece. This is time for you to practice your new skills
and dive deeper into web development with the tutors support.

There are some examples of first websites:

<ul>
<li>
<a href='http://neenan.github.io/sarah/' target="_blank" title="Sarah's site from a free evening Intro to HTML/CSS course">Sarah's site from a free evening Intro to HTML/CSS course</a></li>

## Extra HTML Tips

### Add Meta Data

This cool HTML trick might be the most important if you want your site to be seen.
The meta data is information about your site that you want search engines like Google to know about.

Using HTML, you can give Google a description of your site (which they may or may not use in the search entry for your site, but will certainly use when categorizing it) as well as some keywords relevant to your site.

The code for adding meta data is simple, you put the following in the `<head></head>` of your page:

```
<meta name="description" content="Used auto parts for sale">

<meta name="keywords" content="fuel filters, brake discs, belts" />
```
